What is QScore ?
================

http://qscore.io

QScore is a **competition platform** for Data Science.

It is simple, scalable and can host your competition in a minute.

It works with `Node.js`_, Python_, RabbitMQ_, Redis_, Auth0_, AngularJS_'s CoreUI_ and it is **open source**!


Why do we create QScore ?
-------------------------

Qscore supports a lot of users in a short time.

During the competition of "`Le Meilleur Datascientist de France 2018`_",
we had peaks of 300 submissions in less than 5 seconds.
Most open source platforms we have tested do not work under these stress.
